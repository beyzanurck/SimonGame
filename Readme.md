## Simon Game
- [x] This is a console-based memory game. 
- [x] The numbers next to the colors represent the button number. You can play the game by pressing numbers.
- [x] You have to watch during the "watch" process and press the numbers during the "play" process.
- [x] Terminal dimensions should be 120x49. Otherwise, the game will not work properly.
- [x] The dots are not exactly where they should be because the console does not accept decimals. But I tried to fix it as best I could.
